1) High school Math Data

Data: student demographic information and state test scores from 3 districts participating in an intervention study about high school mathematics education. The files are called: DistrictA.xlsx, DistrictB.csv, DistrictC.docx

Tasks: merge and clean the data

Questions: Do the data suggest that the performance of treatment students is better than the comparison students? Was the intervention more effective for certain students? If so, who? 


2) Middle school Computerized Assessment Data 

Data: the original data consisted of the performance of 615 students in 24 classes with six teachers on the two standardized assessments (pre- and post-tests) and one benchmark assessment.Student data with missing values and opt out choices were removed, leaving a final data of 473 students. Of these, 303 (64%) students were in the treatment group and 170 (36%) students in the control group. 

Tasks: data cleaning and manipulation, ANOVA, T-TEST

Questions: 
1.	How is the use of the computerized instructional modules related to student learning?
2.	To what extent does evidence collected from the benchmark assessments support inferences about a student's proficiency (as determined by a standardized assessment)?
